Since July of 2019, I've been working as a Backend Software Engineer on the <a href="https://one.google.com" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Google One</a> team to build a premium experience at Google. My primary focus has been on building the infrastructure for growth which has meant designing and launching a smart notifications stack, a low latency user signal service (serves 100K+ QPS) and a user targeting service.

Before Google, I worked on <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/our-firm/FICC-and-equities/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Fixed income Securities</a> as a <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/05/strats-jobs-goldman-sachs" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Strat</a> at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/worldwide/india/" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Goldman Sachs</a> at their Bengaluru Offices in India. This was my first real work experience and I learnt quite a bit about building software for trading, thanks to some brilliant coworkers.

In December of 2021, I packed my bags and moved out to California to work at <a href="https://careers.google.com/locations/mountain-view/" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Google's Mountain View Offices</a>. This was largely driven by an instrinsic desire for shaking up my life a little after having stayed at home for the better part of 2 years due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Covid-19</a>.

I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelors In <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/bs" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Mathematics and Scientific Computing</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Kanpur" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">IIT Kanpur</a> in India. The 4 years I spent in Kanpur were among the best times of life thanks to some amazing friends and experiences.

I did all my schooling at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Public_School,_Ranchi" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">Delhi Public School</a> in Ranchi, the city I've called home since the year 2000. Ranchi's claim to fame is that it is the home town of Former Indian Cricket Captain, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni" target="_blank" style="color:#E75480;">M.S Dhoni</a>.

I was born on the 5th of November, 1995 to my wonderful parents and am very lucky to have my little sister in my life, who is my favorite person on this planet.

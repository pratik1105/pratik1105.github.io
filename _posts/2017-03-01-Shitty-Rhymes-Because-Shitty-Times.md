Sometimes I find myself asking,  
Where's happiness ?  

And then I wait for someone to answer.  

Afterall, a species of waiters, that's what we are.  
Right person, right moment, right situation, right this, right that !  

We prefer to suffer and cry,  
let our sorrow multiply,  
allow our dreams to die,  
too afraid to try,  
unwilling to defy,  
content to stand by,  
and all this, why ?  

<i>sigh</i>.  

Sometimes I find myself asking,  
Where's happiness ?  

Maybe we just don't qualify.

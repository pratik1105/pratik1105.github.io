Close those  
Tearful and Fearful and Fierce and Innocent eyes.  
Let go of thoughts  
maddening and saddening and foolish and wise.  

Now Imagine !  

Imagine we are on an island with a rocky shore.  
Fate leads us to a deserted castle's door.  
We decide to spend the night as the rain starts to pour.  
There's lightning and thunder from the hammer of Thor.  

It's cold inside and shivering we stood,  
There's a fireplace with some unburnt wood.  
The warmth draws out memories from under the hood,  
memories of words and actions which we misunderstood.  

We are both tired and yet we are both wide awake.  
No words are uttered for that would be a mistake.  
Suddenly all our disappointments seem undisputedly fake,  
apparently causing heartbreak for its own sake.  

Howlings from wolves breach the silence of the night,  
Music plays from raindrop's and window's fight.  
We lay down and watch the moon shower its light,  
and realize just how finite we are in a world, Infinite.

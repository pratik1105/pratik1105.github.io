Fine lines that divide the right and the wrong.  
Fine lines that divide the good and the bad.  
Fine lines that divide art and madness.  
Fine lines that divide ideal and flawed.  

The whole world is unrelenting it it's attempt  
to teach us to tread carefully along fine lines.  
One step a little wide and you gift yourself  
one freshly minted, nicely decorated, **permanent** *label*.  
 
And you can rip your throat shouting in the streets  
that you are not the labels that you are rewarded with.  
But your shouts, they do not fall on deaf ears.  
For there are hearing aids for deaf ears.  
Instead, your screams resonate through a society  
that hasn't developed the ability to hear.  

Oh how unbearable this constant rope walking is  
for people like us, who need that sense of free will,  
that we decide what happens to our lives.  

Ever so often, I find myself celebrating,  
whenever I manage to just distort these lines  
ever so slightly  
with the magnetic force of my ability to not give a fuck.  

I hope you do too.

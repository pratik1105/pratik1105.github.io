In an alley somewhere far from town,  
In some valley turned dusty and brown,  
In the shabby palace of a just crown,  
you shall find me.  

Trying to comprehend the misunderstood dark,  
Trying to bring the desert a park,  
Trying to ease the mind of the monarch,  
you shall find me.  

With the light from my eyes breaking through,  
With sweat from my forehead turning a dead oasis blue,  
With my bare hands sculpting his majesty's statue,  
you shall find me.  

Leaving behind a glowing road,  
Leaving behind the river that now, flowed,  
Leaving the ruler's majestic abode,  
At some destined crossroad,  
I shall find you too.

It's one of those nights again.  

Sleep is playing hard to get.  
Petrichor, for the streets are wet.  
Howling wolves announce their threat.  
Stories being painted with an infinite palette.  

Travelling through space-time for free.  
From past to future on the count of three.  
Be it re-living stuff that wasn't meant to be,  
or enjoying with a loved one by the sea.  

This back and forth leaves no time for today.  
I am always back there or so far away.  
Thinking of winning, I forgot how to play.  
Help me kind stranger, show me the way !

I have a goal and I want to see it through  
But self-doubt showed up and with time it grew.  

What about the people who are stronger, smarter, "better" than me?  
They'll always out perform me. It's a fact, you can't disagree.  

So why bother? why not just throw in the towel and accept defeat  
Let the others do it and I'll admire/critique, as usual, from the back-seat.  

But Wait.  
How come other people decide what I can achieve or not  
probably because goals are relative just like we are taught.  

So if I set absolute goals and be satisfied with them  
then my self-doubt would have absolutely nothing to condemn.  

Now my mind is clear, focussed and there is something I clearly see  
the only walls which block my success have been built by me.

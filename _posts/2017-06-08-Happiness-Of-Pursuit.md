There is a fire burning inside me  
that keeps me warm  
in a world full of cold people.  

There is a madness about me  
that makes me desperate,  
desperate enough to not be satisfied,  
not be satisfied with being "SANE".  

I am insatiably hungry,  
so much so that often,  
I forget I need to EAT to be alive.  

I have Dreams,  
Dreams that not only sing me to sleep each night  
but also get me out of bed each morning.  

I suffer.  
A lot.  
But never from the heart-breaking, soul-shearing disease  
of *"letting outer reactions affect my inner actions".*  

Instead of indulging in a pursuit of happiness,  
I revel in the happiness of pursuit.

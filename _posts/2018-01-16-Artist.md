Who are you, if not an *artist*.  

When there is atleast one moment each day  
where your existence manages to impress you.  

When there are nights when your eyes refuse to pass into  
oblivion,  
gasping for one last breath of whatever is  
your version of  
*a gulp of cold water in the middle of a hot July night*.  

When you have memories that,  
force you to hold back your tears in the midst of laughter,  
that you wouldn't trade,  
even for **happiness**.  

When silence is your symphony  
or when Music is your silence.  

When you are willing to *love*.

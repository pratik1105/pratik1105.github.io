I know you're my weakness,  
and I know you're aware.  
I try to compose melodies,  
they end up a prayer.  

They say you make me strong,  
but do they even care ?  
For I am tired of asking you for strength,  
when you visit my nightmares.  

You've toyed with my laughter,  
You've kindled my despair.  
You make me claustrophobic,  
when the wind blows my hair.  

But fear is a dark room,  
for only so long can he scare.  
Soon your eyes adjust,  
and then everything's laid bare.  

Our next rendezvous is around the corner,  
and I have secrets to share.  
The dark room is lit up,  
You better beware !

He looked for her when she so desperately wanted to be found  
it had been years since they last met  
she remembers his soft touch, his eyes perfectly round  
the moments they shared, just him and his glowing cigarette.  

He used to visit everyday until one day he decided otherwise  
It broke her tender heart.  
she longed for an explanation that never came, she longed for her unsaid goodbyes  
she knew she had all the words, yet there was no one for whom her lips would part.  

But now there was to be the reunion she had waited for so long  
she could finally hear his side of the story.  
A man she felt was Mr right had done her wrong  
he must plead his case to her, for she was the judge and the jury.  

He looked at her like the day he had won her as a prize  
she was his first book and oh boy was she sublime  
she knew he still loved her for she recognized that look in his eyes  
and that moment was enough for her to last a lifetime.

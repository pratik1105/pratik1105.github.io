Why do questions on tests worry us  
but more fundamental ones do not ?

Have you ever pondered on them  
or you just can't spare a thought ?

Why is it that 2 hours on a screen  
is better motivation than our dearest dream ?

Why is it that we aspire to be creative artists  
and yet risks are nowhere on our lists ?

Why does the determination in our overnight thoughts  
vanish the following morning ?

Why does habitual procrastination not  
blare as a deadly warning ?

Why is pessimism the common denominator  
in the fractions that make up life ?

Why can't Happiness be the butter  
and Hope be the knife.

title: Monsters on your bed
description: This was my submission to the ELS Palindrome poetry contest at IIT Kanpur. We had to use the same words in both halves of the poem with their orders reversed. This was tough. The people over at ELS decided, very generously, to award this as the 2nd winning entry. Big thanks to them.

14 only, was I,  
but, you were 19.  

Realize, don't you,  
Infinite memories, our,  
of (daily) horror movies, vulgar inside jokes (unfunny),  

that night turned into  
(unfunny) jokes inside vulgar movies.  

HORROR(daily) OF OUR MEMORIES : INFINITE.  

You don't realize ?  
19 were you  
but I was only 14.

I see that you have become scared,  
and feel like you're letting everyone down.  
Clear your head of these foolish thoughts and make room,  
The future called, it is almost done with your crown.  

Throw away the scale you keep beside you,  
measuring yourself against others every chance you get.  
Instead, Look inside, change your relatives to absolutes,  
and get to work, there's gallons yet to be sweat.  

Do not let others project their insecurities on you,  
for they come way too easy and far too cheap.  
Its like they say,  
A lion does not concern himself  
with the opinions of the sheep.  

Let me just whisper in your ear,  
and then I'll be out of your way.  
I just thought maybe you've forgotten,  
that you are the <i>greatest</i> of them all today.
